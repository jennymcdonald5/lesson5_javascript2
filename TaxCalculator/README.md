### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. An array is a set of data represented by a single variable name.
    The most common way to create an array is array literal which includes 
    elements, indexes, and references to elements.
2. If/else/nested statements are used to return true or false values,
    and actions can be carried out by the program depending on the value returned.
3. There are multiple types of functions within JavaScript. A general function 
    is completed as a single unit and it is almost identical to methods.
    Different types of functions are used to do different tasks such as a named function
    which names related statements and can call on these statements.
